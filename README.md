Responsiveness is vital for modern web design. The increase of web traffic in modernity is heavily due to the use of mobile phones and tablets. Therefore a professional website must account for usability on any screen sizes. I therefore included media queries for checking and accounting for various screen sizes, and adjusted the websiteâ€™s grid display accordingly.
Some examples of where media queries were used for the web portfolio, is checking for mobile/reduce screen sizes, so that the website may dynamically readjust 2 columns grids into a single column grid. 

However difficulties with mobile support can be more technical, and complicated than UI/UX designs. On mobile browsers there is a lack of support for animated svg files, and therefore the background may not load on some devices. This issue can often be unexpected until the final deployment of the website on mobile phones. 

The solution for the lack of animated backgrounds on mobile browsers aims to bring animations to the mobile web application, as seen in the desktop versions. Currently a static background will be in place while a complete and fully integrated solution is being developed. 

Further revisions for the website are in place. Some features include sorting by skills, and overall redesign.
